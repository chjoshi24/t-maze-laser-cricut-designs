# T-maze designs (Adobe Illustrator, SVG, and PDF files)

This repository contains designs for T-mazes with different stem and arm lengths. You can use these files to make T-mazes from different materials (For example, Plexiglass/Acrylic, wood, or paper).

I have used these files to make plexiglass T-mazes with a laser cutter and to cut T-shaped paper overlays with a Cricut machine at the [CATalyst studios, University of Arizona](https://lib.arizona.edu/catalyst) for one of my PhD projects. Check out the pre-print from that project **[here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.23.696297v1)**. 

Hope you find these files useful!


## **Overview of the folders**

laser-cutting-files- This contains Adobe illustrator files ( .ai files) for laser cutting. I have also put photos ( .jpg files) of the plexiglass mazes (thickness= 1/8 inch) that I made using these files using an Epilog laser cutting machine at the CATalyst studios, University of Arizona library.

cricut-files- This folder has SVG vector files ( .svg files) for cricut machine. I have used more than one cricut machine, so these files should ideally work across all cricut machines.

pdf-files- This folder has pdf copies of the above files ( .pdf files). 

## **Important notes about the files**
* The stroke width (i.e., the line width) used for Adobe Illustrator files here is 0.072 pt. Typically, all laser cutting machines have a threshold stroke width, below which they cut the desired shape and above which they engrave (and therefore do not cut) the shape into the material. So, do check that stroke width for your machine and adjust that stroke width accordingly before proceeding. The Adobe Illustrator files are editable. 
* The SVG files are created for making T-shaped cutouts using Cricut machines (Stroke width = 0.072 pt). It is a good idea to check what the appropriate stroke width is for your machine before proceeding. You can always edit the Adobe Illustrator file and save it as an SVG file.
  

## **Safety-related notes**
* Make sure to undergo the necessary training to operate the laser cutting, Cricuit, or any other machine that you are going to use.
* Read and follow all the necessary safety instructions.
* Contact the relevant personnel who are in charge of the machine/facility for any questions.
