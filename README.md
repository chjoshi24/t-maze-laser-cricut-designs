# T-maze designs (Adobe Illustrator, SVG, and PDF files)

This repository contains designs for T-mazes with different stem and arm lengths. You can use these files to make T-mazes from different materials (For example, Plexiglass/Acrylic, wood, or paper).
You can make the T-maze using a laser cutter/engraver (Plexiglass recommended, as paper/cardboard may not be safe) or a Cricut machine (typically for papers or thick cardboards).

Use case: I have used it to make plexiglass T-mazes using a laser cutter and cut T-shaped paper overlays using a Cricut machine for one of my PhD projects. Check out the pre-print from that project **[here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.23.696297v1)**

## **Important notes about the files**
* The stroke width (i.e., the line width) used for Adobe Illustrator files here is 0.072 pt. Typically, all laser cutting machines have a threshold stroke width, below which they cut the desired shape and above which they engrave (and therefore do not cut) the shape into the material. So, do check that stroke width for your machine and adjust that stroke width accordingly before proceeding. The Adobe Illustrator files are editable.
* The SVG files are created for making T-shaped cutouts using Cricut machines (Stroke width = 0.072 pt). It is a good idea to check what the appropriate stroke width is for your machine before proceeding. You can always edit the Adobe Illustrator file and save it as an SVG file.
  

## **Safety-related notes**
Make sure to undergo the necessary training to operate the laser cutting, cricuit or any other machine that you are going to use; read and follow all the necessary safety instructions; and contact the relevant personnel who are in charge of the machine/facility for any questions.
